        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="section" id="about-me">   My name is Jonathan Nwokeji, and I am a computer science student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I have a passion for technology and enjoy learning about new advancements in the field, especially in machine learning. In my free time, I love playing soccer and handball, where I play as a goalie. I also enjoy hiking and exploring the outdoors. I also love watching TV (Rick and Morty is my favorite show) and listening to music, like rap, jazz, classical music, and pop. My favorite musical artist so far is JPEGMAFIA.</p>
